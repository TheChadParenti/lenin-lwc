# lenin-lwc

The version of LWC that you can download from marxists.org is a zip file that contains separate html files for each chapter as well as the appendix and index page. This was quite cumbersome to navigate on my e-reader, so I used an html consolidation tool (after manually changing the encoding to UTF-8 lol) to smash everything together. If you have an e-reader that you can upload html/css files onto, you can clone this repo and yeet the files onto it. I think it makes for a better reading experience on the e-reader.
